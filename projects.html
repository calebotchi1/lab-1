            <h3>Motown Studios Database System</h3>
            <p> I designed a database system for Motown Studios, a theoretical Ghanaian based studio with 5 branches across the country.<br>
                The studio needed a system to keep track of all activities inall of its branches. 
                This system would allow studio employees and recording artistes to book studio rooms, instruments, instrumentalists, <br>
                sound engineers, etc. It would also allow for people to check availability of certain rooms or engineers to enhance <br>
                planning and organisation.
